## 🌟 About

Boundless Minds is an inclusive educational platform designed to make learning accessible for specially-abled communities. Our mission is to make society better by ensuring that educational opportunities are available to all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

## 🎯 Mission

We aim to address the exclusion problem resulting from inaccessible educational platforms that exclude an important portion of the student population.
